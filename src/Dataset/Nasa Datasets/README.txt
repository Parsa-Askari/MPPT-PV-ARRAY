ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN: All‑sky surface shortwave downwelling irradiance (Global Horizontal Irradiance, GHI); the primary driver of PV power since it measures total incoming solar energy on a horizontal plane.

CLRSKY_SFC_SW_DWN: Clear‑sky surface shortwave downwelling irradiance; gives the theoretical maximum under cloud‐free conditions, allowing you to isolate cloud impacts by comparison with ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN

ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DNI: Direct Normal Radiation; quantifies the beam component normal to the sun’s rays—critical for tracking systems and models that separate direct vs. diffuse contributions. 

ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DIFF: Diffuse radiation on a horizontal surface; represents scattered light under cloudy or hazy conditions, which still contributes to PV output

ALLSKY_KT: Insolation clearness index (ratio of surface to top‑of‑atmosphere irradiance); a concise proxy for overall atmospheric transmissivity and cloudiness.

T2M: Air temperature at 2 m; PV module efficiency decreases with higher ambient temperatures, so temperature is a key derating factor. 

RH2M: Relative humidity at 2 m; high humidity can attenuate solar irradiance via absorption and scattering.

WS10M: Wind speed at 10 m; convective cooling from wind can lower module temperature and improve efficiency.

CLOUD_AMT_DAY: Daylight cloud amount; direct measure of cloud cover fraction, one of the strongest short‑term modulators of PV output
